# hello-world
A generic repository for testing stuff, ideas, and fooling around.

I'm a web developer who has worked as a video game designer, a UX designer, and as a QA person. I consider myself a generalist, good at everything involved in developing a project from concept to final product. I'm especially proficient with CSS and all JavaScript varients.
